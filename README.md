# Extinction-Revival
A revival of the ComputerCraft Extinction engine for top-down shooters. Anyone can make pull requests for this repository but if they add
features, make the pull request in the ExTest folder instead of the Extinction folder. If the feature is deemed stable, it will be added
to the main Extinction code. Bug fixes will be merged into the main Extinction code.
